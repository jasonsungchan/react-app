**** Please note that this is the early test version of my personal project so it may not have a full functionality.**

1. This project was created to test my knowledge in React fundamentals, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. This simple app is similar to CAPTCHA which is used to distinguish human based on its user input.
3. The difference between this app and CAPTCHA is that it allows users to choose multiple objects on a single image, instead of chossing an entire image.
4. In order to start, simply read the prompt and choose the following section on the image.

**What will be on the final version?**
1. In the final version, there will be more algorithms added for security.
2. Randomized images to be displayed each time the page is rendered.
3. More validation steps to be added.
